# A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images

This repo consist of our project which was done under the guidance of IBM-Nalaiya Thiran Scheme.

The goal of this project is to help the doctors in operation theatres or a sterile environment where physical contact between persons should be avoided in order to be sterilized and also prevent from any infections.

In this project Gesture based Desktop automation, First the model is trained pre trained on the images of different hand gestures, such as a showing number with fingers as 1 ,2,3,4. This model uses the integrated webcam to capture the video frame. The image of the gesture captured in the video frame is compared with the pre-trained model and the gesture is identified. If the gesture predicts is 1; then images are blurred; 2, image is resized; 3, image is rotated etc.
